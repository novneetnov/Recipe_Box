This week I built a Recipe Box where signed in users can upload their recipies. The Functionality includes: users signing in and out, image uploading, descriptions about the recipe, adding ingredients and adding directions to cook.

This week I have used haml instead of erb.

I will be deploying this to heroku soon.
